Model in Motion is a memo series for leaders who have to make AI decisions
that stand up in the boardroom, not just look good on LinkedIn.

It is written by Ayush Agarwal, a product and tech leader who builds and
implements AI systems in real organisations — not slide decks. The goal is
simple: sharper thinking, clearer decisions, and fewer wasted AI projects.
