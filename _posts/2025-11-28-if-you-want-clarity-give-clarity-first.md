I’ve noticed that candidates often start interviews by giving a broad summary of their work. Without context, they try to cover as much as possible, and I end up evaluating noise instead of relevant signals. I realized this pattern was causing me to misjudge people early.

Recently, while interviewing a PM candidate over Teams, I asked him to walk me through his resume, and he talked at length about projects unrelated to our domain and the role. I mentally rejected him early. At the end, he asked what the role actually involved, and once I explained it, the entire conversation changed.

The moment he understood the actual problem space, he connected his experience to it immediately. It was clear that his earlier answers were not capability issues but a context issue. I realized I wasn’t giving the candidates the information they needed to show their real competence.

Since then, I have changed the opening. I start by anchoring the interview—who I am, what the company does, and the problem the role is meant to solve. Only after that do I ask them to talk about their work.

The quality of the conversations has improved significantly. Candidates present the most relevant parts of their work, and I get far clearer signals early.
